//Baxter 6 DOF Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics Validation//

A set of joint angles is initially assumed to compute the Transformation Matrix in the Forward Kinematics validation part.

This Transformation matrix is used in the Inverse Kinematics equations to get back the Joint variables in the Inverse Kinematics Validation part.

Note: The joint variables are defined at the start of the program and can be changed to validate the FK and IK.
